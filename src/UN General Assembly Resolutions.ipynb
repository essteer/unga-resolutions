    "Some initial pre-processing takes place in `src/records.py`, in the form of converting the raw data to strings or integers, sorting countries within vote lists, and arranging columns for further processing.\n",

    "More involved processing then takes place in `src/preprocessing.py`, which expands the vote records for each resolution to populate columns for each individual Member State, and consolidates Member States based on the conditions desribed in `README.md`. It is also at this stage that resolution dates are converted to a unified format, and that resolutions are sorted by date and then reference number.\n",

    "The `src/preprocessing.py` file also drops certain columns, which are retained in the `\"YYYYMMDD_HHMM_records.csv\"` files in case of future requirement, but are not necessary for this project. The \"Record URL\" and \"Segment\" columns are added during the retrieval process, and record the full URL and URL segment of each resolution. The \"Meeting Record\", \"Draft Resolution\", \"Committee Report\", and \"Note\" columns come from the raw data, but are not required for this exercise.\n",

    "Those 255 entities are consolidated down to 199 via the process described in this project's `README.md` file, typically by merging Member States that are the same entity but have changed their official names, but also by assessing political changes that have resulted in the merger or dissolution of Member States.\n",

    "Of the 199 consolidated entities referred to above, 193 are current Member States as of January 2024. The former Member States for whcih is has not been possible to align their records with current Member States are Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Federation of Malaya, Serbia and Montenegro, Yemen (PDR), and Yugoslavia.\n",
